LocalBot Classic
================

LocalBot Classic is an old, (now unsupported version) of LocalBot that was in use on LocalCoast IRC from 2008-2010. 

The codebase was discontinued in 2009. In 2013, some basic refactoring was done, and the code was released as open source software.


## Requirements
 * PHP 5.0+

## Creating Modules

LocalBot provides a simple API for creating modules, and is capable of hook/event based programming. For simple scripts, it also supports Ziggi (botzilla) modules.
